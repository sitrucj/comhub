#Community Hub
This is a social map for people to post markers made with a the yeoman, openlayers and a MEAN stack. 

##Future Ideas
- adding either local media or social media to enrich the map with details for the users
- new areas of interest bassed on twitter or facebook?
- an event marker layer for events happening at a location
- a way to find important topics by region by way of user ranking
- User intergration with social media
