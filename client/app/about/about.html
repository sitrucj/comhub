		  <h3>Welcome to the beta version of Community Hub!</h3>
		  <h4>Community Hub is not just a soap box to shout from.</h4>
		  <p>
				We are about building smarter communities by fostering constant community input. Community hub is for busy city managers who are seeking broad community input and are afraid of negativity on sensitive issues. We empower stakeholders by giving a channel for two way communication. This is a not a new concept for anyone but it is a new perspective. By allowing for two way information sharing constituents are empowered to help build their community with the government. Markers on the map represent the issues that matter to stakeholders. They can be a concept about the official plan or a specific issue like changing a speed limit. Community Hub is easy and accessible to everyone that wants information and allows for continuous feedback.
